Inspiration:
I took inspiration from social studies and history classes. I was intrigued by the fact that wealth was concentrated in developed countries, even though there was enough to redistribute. To create an equal playing field, I planned to create a website that could solve this issue. This satisfied UN sustainable development goals 8 and 17: Decent work and Economic growth, and Partnerships for the goals.

What it does:
The website utilizes export and import data about developing countries to recommended them other like-minded countries, that align with their commercial objectives.

How I built it:
The website was built using python's Streamlit library, a powerful, streamlined UI development package. I extracted the data by using the web scraping libraries Requests and BeautifulSoup (bs4). Using the export and import data from the website, I converted a python dictionary with the data into a csv file using Pandas. Subsequently, I read and compared the export and import data of multiple countries, examining the degree of similarity they shared. Finally, I wrapped up all parts of the program and integrated it into a Streamlit GUI.

Challenges I ran into:
I found it difficult to extract the correct export and import data from the website. Additionally, it took a substantial amount of time to convert the text, scraped off the website, into a usable, standardized format, eventually into a csv.

Accomplishments that I am proud of:
I am most proud of understanding an issue of utmost importance that has its relevance in the modern era. Another thing that I am proud of is my execution of my plan, succeeding in the web scraping, and UI elements of our program.

What I learned:
I delved deeper into previously known concepts such as web scraping as well as exploring new ways in UI/UX development, gaining a deep grasp of how to make a streamlined GUI with an emphasis on user experience.

What's next for Expert Exports:
This website—if implemented by major export companies and administrators around the world—could cause great economic growth and lower reliance on core states.
